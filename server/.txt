**Express.js** is a popular web application framework for Node.js.
It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications quickly and easily.



**Routing**: In a Node.js application, routing is typically handled by a router (like Express.js router). 
The router directs incoming requests to the appropriate controller based on the URL and HTTP method.
Express.js simplifies the process of defining routes for handling different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
Routes are defined using methods like app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), etc.



**Controller Logic**: Each route typically maps to a controller function. 
The controller function is responsible for processing the request, interacting with the model layer (if necessary), 
and preparing the response.



**Interaction with Models**: Controllers often interact with the model layer to retrieve or manipulate data. 
Models represent the data structure and business logic of the application.
Controllers utilize these models to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
